# **Java Programming I - MOOC.fi OOP Exercises**

This repository contains some of the **practice exercises** from the **MOOC.fi Java Programming I** course, focusing on **basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Java. I solved all my practice exercises without the use of AI, completing them entirely through my own logic, reasoning, and coding skills.

## **Coverage**

The exercises cover:

- **Classes and Objects** – defining your own classes and creating objects  
- **Constructors** – initializing objects with specific values  
- **Methods** – adding behavior to your classes  
- **Fields / Attributes** – storing data inside objects
